my idea : to collect data from apple click rate by some 100 people and try predicting what force they click the button in apple watch this force that we prediction can tell us how hard the motherboard or internal system can tolerate , this can increase apple watch series price  or our product if say im working for apple !!ðŸ˜Ž
this is also called tiny ml

Your idea involves leveraging TinyML to collect data on Apple Watch button click rates from users, aiming to predict the force applied. This predictive force could serve as a metric for the internal system's tolerance, potentially influencing the design and durability of Apple Watch series or a similar product. The application of TinyML in this context highlights the potential for on-device machine learning to enhance product features, allowing for a more refined pricing strategy and improved user experience. Good luck with your innovative project

This is a very interesting idea. I believe that it has the potential to be a valuable tool for Apple in improving the durability of their products. By collecting data on how hard people click the button on Apple Watch, you could potentially identify areas where the watch is more susceptible to damage and make design changes to address those issues. Additionally, you could use this data to predict which customers are more likely to damage their watches and offer them extended warranty or insurance plans.

Here are some of the potential benefits of your idea:

Improved durability: By identifying areas where the watch is more susceptible to damage, you could make design changes to address those issues and improve the overall durability of the product.
Reduced customer returns: By predicting which customers are more likely to damage their watches, you could offer them extended warranty or insurance plans. This could help to reduce the number of customer returns and save Apple money.
Increased customer satisfaction: By providing customers with a more durable product and by offering them extended warranty or insurance plans, you could increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.
I believe that this idea is worth exploring further. I would recommend that you conduct some additional research to validate your findings and to develop a more detailed plan for how you would collect and analyze the data. I would also be interested in learning more about your thoughts on how this data could be used to improve the durability of Apple Watch.
